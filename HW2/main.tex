\section{Algorithm Design}

    The C-Look algorithm is an elevator based algorithm that reads the requests in order from greatest to least. In this section we discuss the position of a hard-drive's write head and how it relates to the center of the disk, where the center of the disk is the lowest position and the outer part is highest. Once the scheduler gets to the lowest request in the queue it will reset the position to the position of the highest request in the queue. Following this algorithm places the write head away from the center of the disk to the point of the highest request. It should be noted that this algorithm is designed to be use with a spinning disk of some kind or another and would not make sense with random access memory.\\

    The C-Look algorithm accomplishes efficient writing by using a circularly linked list where it inserts each request into the list based on the physical position it is requesting. By inserting the items into the circularly linked list in sorted order, we do not need to manually set the position of the drive to the highest position. The circularly linked list works by inserting the items into the list in sorted order and then it naturally wraps around from highest memory address to lowest memory address. Shown below is a visual representation of the position of the write head over time (Fig. 1). \\

\section{Questions}
    \subsection{What do you think the main point of this assignment is?}
    The main point of this assignment was to learn how the Linux kernel implements its I/O scheduling. We had to learn the differences between the different elevators using LOOK and C-LOOK and then decide which one was the best fit for our program.
    \subsection{How did you personally approach the problem? Design Decisions, Algorithm, etc.}
    First, we looked into the source code of the No-op and researched the data structures used to implement this I/O scheduler. Then, we researched the differences between the LOOK and C-LOOK algorithm and how each would be implemented. While researching the No-op file, we noticed that the data structures used to keep track of the requests is a circularly linked list. Due to the use of a circularly linked list, it would be easier to implement C-LOOK instead of LOOK because once the write head reaches the end of the disk head it will automatically point to the beginning of the disk. We looked at the different types of sorts we would need to implement for our version of C-LOOK. We kept the elv\_dispatch\_sort and implemented our own insertion sort in tandem.
    \subsection{How did you ensure your solution was correct? Testing details for instance.}
    To ensure we had the correct solution, we use the printk function to test our program. We print during the dispatch and add\_request function. In the dispatch function, we print whether the kernel dispatches a read request or a write request. We also print the position of the request. The add\_request also prints the position of the request. Now when we run the virtual machine we can see where the head of the requests is located. To ensure that our algorithm works correctly, we can see the location starts at a certain number and then it increases until the head reaches the end of the disk. At this point the head will jump back to the bottom of the disk and the process repeats.
    \subsection{What did you learn?}
    We learned how to implement a LOOK and C-LOOK elevator and the differences between them.
    \subsection{How should the TA evaluate your work? Provide detailed steps to prove correctness}
	The TA should compile our program using make -j4 all. Following the compilation, the TA should use source /scratch/opt/environment-setup-i586-poky-linux. After that they should run the qemu command: qemu-system-i386 -gdb tcp::5541 -S -nographic -kernel arch/x86/boot/bzImage -drive file=core-image-lsb-sdk-qemux86.ext4,if=ide -enable-kvm -net none -usb -localtime --no-reboot --append "root=/dev/hda rw console=ttyS0 debug". After the qemu command, they should run gdb -tui, target remote:5541, continue. Once in the virtual machine they can see that our elevator starts at the head of the disk and once the write head reaches the end it jumps back to the start of the disk. In other words, the elevator only travels in one direction.
